# NarrateDAO OS

## Introduction

NarrateDAO aims to be the indispensable open-source governance operating system (OS) for the Web3 space. It provides stable, secure, and scalable primitives for social-first DAO governance. The success of NarrateDAO will be measured by the adoption of its core infrastructure by other developers and projects building diverse applications and user interfaces on top of it. The core idea is to focus on providing a rock-solid and scalable core, enabling the community to build applications on top, similar to how Ethereum provides the base blockchain and countless dApps flourish on it.

## Project Overview

This document details the software architecture for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of NarrateDAO. It serves as a foundation for the development team to build and iterate on the product and provides guidance for community contributors to understand the system design and participate in development.

## Scope (MVP)

The scope of this document focuses on the backend OS components required for the "minimal core" MVP of NarrateDAO. This includes the core data ingestion and transformation layer, minimal trust voting primitives, and the developer APIs supporting these functionalities. Frontend UI components (such as Farcaster Frames or Web UI libraries), while crucial parts of the ecosystem, are outside the detailed design scope of this core backend architecture document and will be treated as example applications built on the APIs described herein.

## Architecture Goals and Principles

### Architecture Goals

- **Stability & Reliability:** Provide a highly available core system to ensure uninterrupted governance processes.
- **Security:** Prioritize secure design to protect user data and the integrity of governance operations.
- **Scalability:** Design components with both horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities to accommodate future growth in users and data volume.
- **Extensibility (Functionality):** Core primitives should be easily extensible and customizable by other developers.
- **Developer Experience:** Offer clear APIs, good documentation, and tools to facilitate integration and building.
- **Data Integrity & Auditability:** Ensure all governance-related data is traceable, tamper-proof, and easily auditable.

### Design Principles

- **Modularity:** The system consists of loosely coupled, functionally independent modules for easy independent development, testing, deployment, and upgrades.
- **Service-orientation:** Core functionalities are exposed as services via clearly defined APIs.
- **Minimal Trust:** Minimize reliance on centralized components in the design of voting and execution mechanisms.
- **Openness & Interoperability:** Adopt open standards for easy integration with other Web3 protocols and tools.
- **Progressive Decentralization:** While the MVP may rely on certain centralized components (e.g., OpenAI API), the long-term goal is to evolve towards more decentralized alternatives.
