// NarrateDAO OS: Basic Reputation/Weighting Service
// Purpose: Provide an initial, extensible mechanism for calculating voting weight.
// Core Functionality (MVP):
// - Calculate voter weight based on preset logic (e.g., token balance, basic Farcaster metrics).
// - Designed as a pluggable module for future replacement or extension.

// TODO: Implement basic reputation/weighting logic.
