// NarrateDAO OS: Off-Chain Voting Service
// Purpose: Provide a secure and auditable off-chain voting mechanism.
// Core Functionality (MVP):
// - Receive and validate user votes with signatures (e.g., EIP-712).
// - Determine voting weight using the Reputation/Weighting Service.
// - Store valid vote data via the Data Persistence Service.

// TODO: Implement off-chain voting logic, signature validation, and interaction with other services.
