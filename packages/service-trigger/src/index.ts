// NarrateDAO OS: On-Chain Execution Trigger Service
// Purpose: Provide a minimal trust bridge to trigger on-chain actions after off-chain social consensus is reached.
// Core Functionality (MVP):
// - Provide API endpoint to initiate on-chain execution.
// - Integrate Snapshot API to create formal governance votes on Snapshot.
// - (Optional MVP) Integrate Thirdweb SDK to call smart contract functions.

// TODO: Implement execution trigger logic and integrations with Snapshot/Thirdweb.
